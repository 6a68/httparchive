1 - Delete/rename results.txt and har folder from previous batch (once this file exists it will keep operating on the existing tests, you need to remove it to start a new set)

2 - Populate urls.txt with the list of urls you want tested

3 - Modify settings.inc for the test conditions (locations to use, number of runs, video capture, etc)

4 - "php submit.php" - This will submit all of the tests.  If you see any errors reported just run it again and it will re-submit any that didn't get submitted properly

5 - "php status.php" - Run this until it tells you all tests have finished (or until it stops making progress in case some didn't get tested at all)

6 - If not all of the tests finished, run "php resubmit.php" and go back to #5

7 - "php gethar.php" - This will fetch har files for all of the urls and store them in a "har" sub directory
